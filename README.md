# React-Native + Redux + Redux-Persist + RNN with TypeScript 

### Key Benefits of TypeScript?
> - Strict typing : Everything stays the way we define it
> - Structural typing : Indispensable when you care about fully defining the actual structure you use
> - A handy way of saying explicitly what type should be used
> - Type inference :  Implicit typing performed by TypeScript itself, so that your developers donâ€™t need to provide types where the compiler can find them on its own

### Purpose of the repo 
> 1. Bottom tab navigation : HOME, MORE
> 2. Home Screen : White screen
> 3. More Screen : There is "Open Model" button to show model where fetch user data from gorest.co.in api and show data in flatList with Card
> 4. Use Wix navigation: https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation
> 5. Use Modal : https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/modal/
> 6. There is a button "Add" button,on click of it should go to a subview within the same modal where we can add some text and press DONE.
> 7. When we add the text and press done, we should automatically go back to the modal and the text that we added should be in a card on top of the list.
> 6. If we close the app and relaunch it, we should see the same list in the modal (with redux persist). (No need to fetch again, only first time)
